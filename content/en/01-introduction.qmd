## The promise of the EKC

Since 1991, one hypothesis has influenced political discourse on climate and development:

> **"Economic growth ultimately reduces pollution."**

This **Environmental Kuznets Curve** (EKC[^ekc]) posits that CO$_2$ emissions 
follow an inverted U-shape: they increase during industrialization, peak, and then 
spontaneously decline as countries become wealthier.

*Some policymakers have interpreted the EKC as justifying a wait-and-see approach: if 
growth spontaneously reduces emissions beyond a certain threshold, regulatory constraints 
would be unnecessary (Beckerman, 1992). However, this interpretation remains 
controversial, as it overlooks the underlying institutional mechanisms.*

## Data used

### Source and justification

To test the EKC hypothesis, we use the **consolidated dataset from Our World in Data (OWID)**[^owid], 
which aggregates two reference sources:

- **Global Carbon Project** for CO$_2$ emissions
- **World Bank** for economic indicators (PPP-adjusted GDP[^ppa])

::: {.callout-note}
## Why OWID rather than the World Bank API?

Initially, we attempted to extract data directly via the `wbgapi` API for standard indicators 
(`EN.ATM.CO2E.PC` and `NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD`). However, technical instabilities 
(timeouts, JSON decoding errors) led us to favor the OWID repository, 
which offers the same source data in a consolidated and stable format.

### Variables selected

| Variable | Description | Unit |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `co2_per_capita` | CO$_2$ emissions per capita | tons/capita/year |
| `gdp_per_capita` | GDP per capita | international $ (PPP, constant prices) |
| `country` | Country name | — |
| `iso_code` | ISO-3 code | — |
| `year` | Year of observation | — |

### Scope of the analysis

```{python}
#| echo: false

# ATTENTION : Vérifiez que les variables ci-dessous (START_YEAR, etc.) 
# sont bien définies dans votre environnement Python. 
# Sinon, remplacez-les par les noms français (ANNEE_DEBUT_DATA, etc.)

| Dimension | Value | Justification |

| **Countries** | {N_COUNTRIES} countries | Exclusion of continental aggregates (filtering on `iso_code`) |

## Structural limitations of the data

**What we gain:**
- Consistency of sources (OWID harmonizes Global Carbon Project + World Bank)
- International comparability (GDP in purchasing power parity)

**What we concede:**
- **Territorial emissions only**: the *pollution haven* bias remains possible
- **National aggregation**: regional disparities are masked

## The problem: thirty years without consensus

The EKC hypothesis owes its name to an analogy with Kuznets' (1955) curve on inequality. Grossman and Krueger (1991) transposed it to local pollutants, without claiming it to be a universal law. However, this methodological caveat has been lost along the way.

After thirty years of research, **no consensus has emerged**:

| Study | Main result | Identified limitation |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Stern (2004) | Results highly sensitive to econometric choices | Massive heterogeneity of specifications |
| Wagner (2008, 2015) | Flawed regressions due to non-stationarity | Untreated time series issues |
| Peters et al. (2011) | Territorial emissions mask relocations | Pollution haven bias |
| Allard et al. (2018) | Possible **N** curve at very high incomes | Post-decoupling rebound |

This heterogeneity justifies our approach: testing the EKC with **explicit, rigorous, and reproducible** methodological choices.

**Our strategy corrects three major biases identified in the literature:**

| Identified limitation | Source | Our methodological correction | Section |
|-----------------------|--------|-------------------------------|---------|
| Fallacious regressions (non-stationarity) | Wagner (2015) | ADF tests + ARDL model | 5.2, 5.3 |
| Untested rebound (N-shaped curve) | Allard et al. (2018) | Cubic specification with empirical validation | 4.2, 4.3 |
| Heterogeneity of specifications | Stern (2004) | Robustness tests (Box-Cox, cross-validation, LOWESS) | 8.1, 8.2, 4.4 |

## Our empirical strategy

We test the EKC using **two complementary approaches** and **two distinct objectives**:

```{python}
#| echo: false

if DATA_LOADED:
    display(Markdown(f"""
### Dual approach: Space and Time

| Approach | Sample | Period | Key question |
|----------|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Cross-sectional** | {N_COUNTRIES} countries | {CROSS_YEAR} | Do rich countries pollute less *today*? |
| **Temporal** | United States | {START_DATA_YEAR}–{END_DATA_YEAR} | Does a country reduce its emissions *as it becomes richer*? |
"""))
```

### Dual objective: Estimate and Predict

| Objective | Question | Validation method |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Estimation** | What functional form describes the GDP-CO₂ relationship? | Nested F tests, AIC, coefficient significance |
| **Prediction** | Does the model generalize to unused data? | Cross-validation (k=5), out-of-sample test, benchmark vs. random walk |

**Triangulation strategy**: 

1. **Convergence of forms**: If the two approaches (cross-sectional/temporal) 
   converge toward the same specification, this reinforces structural robustness.

2. **Estimation/prediction convergence**: A statistically significant 
   but predictively weak model would indicate overfitting. We favor 
   models that **perform well on both dimensions**.

3. **In case of divergence**: We will analyze whether the discrepancies stem from 
   spatial heterogeneity, temporal inertia, or overfitting.

## Report Structure

The content is organized into four analytical sections, followed by a conclusion:

1. **Theoretical and Methodological Framework**  
   Foundations of the EKC hypothesis, choice of specification, and econometric strategy adopted.

2. **The Synchronic Approach: Snapshot of the World (2020)**  
   Global cross-section: is there a "structural law" between wealth and pollution?

3. **The Diachronic Approach: The Trajectory of the United States (1990-2020)**  
   US time series: is decoupling really emerging over time?

4. **Comparing Results — The Political Dilemma**  
   Space versus time: what are the implications for Southern countries and global climate policies?

Each chapter combines **hypothesis testing**, **econometric diagnostics**, and **recommendations based on the results**.
