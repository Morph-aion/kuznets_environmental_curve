## The Confrontation: Space vs. Time

Our two approaches converge on a central point: **the quadratic model (inverted U) 
is sufficient**. The cubic term is significant neither cross-sectionally ($p = 0.995$) nor 
temporally ($p > 0.10$). The hypothesis of an emissions rebound at very high income levels 
(N-shaped curve) is **rejected** by our data.

However, the two approaches reveal **complementary dynamics**:

| Dimension | Cross-sectional (2020) | Temporal (USA 1990-2020) |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Question** | Do the rich pollute less? | Does a country decarbonize as it gets richer? |
| **Answer** | **Yes** ($\beta_2 < 0$ significant) | **Yes, but slowly** ($\rho \approx 1$) |
| **Limitation** | Static snapshot | Unique case (generalizability?) |

**Interpretation**: The 2020 global snapshot shows decoupling **already achieved** 
in rich countries. But the American "movie" reveals that this decoupling was **slow, progressive, 
and potentially fragile**.

## Lesson 1: Structural Inertia

The temporal analysis reveals **extreme persistence** in emission levels ($\rho \approx 1.00$).

**What does $\rho \approx 1$ mean concretely?**

- Shocks to emissions are **quasi-permanent**
- A coal plant built today will emit for 40 years
- Energy infrastructure locks in emission trajectories

**Policy implication**:

> *Decoupling does not accelerate spontaneously.*
> Waiting for the "natural turning point" of the EKC is a high-risk strategy.
> Every year of delay locks in future emissions.

**Key figure**: With a short-term elasticity of $-0.12$, it would take **$+8\%$ 
annual growth** to reduce emissions by $1\%$ per year — a pace insufficient 
for the Paris goals.

## Lesson 2: Heterogeneity of Trajectories

Residual analysis (Section 4.2.3) reveals that the "average" EKC masks 
**three clubs of countries**:

| Profile | Examples | Position vs EKC | Characteristic |
|---------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Decarbonized** | France, Sweden, Switzerland | Below the curve | Low-carbon mix (nuclear, hydro) |
| **Carbon-intensive** | Qatar, Kuwait, Australia | Above the curve | Fossil rent, extreme climate |
| **In transition** | China, India, Brazil | Ascending phase | Ongoing industrialization |

**Why is Sweden $\neq$ Qatar at comparable GDP?**

At $\approx 50,000\text{ \$/capita}$, Sweden emits $\approx 4\text{ tCO}_2/\text{capita}$ while Qatar emits $\approx 35\text{ tCO}_2/\text{capita}$.
This **factor of 9** difference is explained by:

1. **Energy mix**: Hydropower (Sweden) vs. Natural Gas (Qatar)
2. **Economic structure**: Services (Sweden) vs. Extraction (Qatar)
3. **Climate**: Efficient heating (Sweden) vs. Intensive air conditioning (Qatar)
4. **Policies**: Carbon tax since 1991 (Sweden) vs. Fossil fuel subsidies (Qatar)

**Conclusion**: The EKC describes a **conditional trend**, not a universal law.
Decoupling depends on technological and institutional choices, not just income.

## Technological "Tunneling"

Can developing countries **avoid** the emission peak of industrialized nations?

**Concept**: "Tunneling" (Munasinghe, 1999) refers to the possibility of "digging a tunnel"
under the EKC curve by directly adopting clean technologies.
